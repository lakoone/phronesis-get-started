## Good for writers

Writers need strong tooling so they can deliver a lot of content in a short time.
Efficiency is key, so this platform supports [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/) format (it's a lot like Markdown, but with added niceness).

Build-in link checking and branch previews lets writers move quickly and safely when creating content or managing updates.

## Good for readers

Clean layout and a visible table of contents makes good content a pleasure to read and process.
