# What made you smile?
- Easy to change logo (dark/light mode support)
- The documentation is well written
- Easy to adjust redirects

# What did you find confusing?
* SVG logos don't react to theme changes (it would be great if the config supported a color adjustment for svg) 
> for example using one `src` logo but different colors for dark/light mode
> `srcSet: "https://redocly.com/assets/logo.svg dark(#fffff), light(#bbbbb)"`
