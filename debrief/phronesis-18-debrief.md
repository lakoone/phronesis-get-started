# Project 18: Side by Side Template

## What Made You Smile?
- The possibility of customizing templates and creating custom components that can be used in Markdoc tags within a Markdown file.

{% img src="./images/the-universe-tim-and-eric-mind-blown.gif" alt="the-universe-tim-and-eric-mind-blown.gif" withLightbox=true width="" height="" /%}


## What Did You Find Confusing?
- The dedicated instruction page was really helpfulâ€”why isn't it available in the documentation?
- The configuration is error-prone. Watch out for letter casing, whitespace, component naming, etc.
