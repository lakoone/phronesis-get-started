# Introduction to Digital Wallet Ticketing

## What is Digital Wallet Ticketing?

Digital wallet ticketing represents a modern approach to ticket management that allows users to store and access their tickets directly in digital wallets on their smartphones (such as Apple Wallet, Google Wallet, and Samsung Wallet). Unlike traditional QR code systems that require opening a specific app or email, digital wallet tickets are:

- **Always accessible** - stored directly in the smartphone's native wallet app
- **Available offline** - no internet connection required to display the ticket
- **Automatically displayed** - appear on the lock screen when relevant (based on time/location)
- **Interactive** - can update dynamically with new information
- **Secure** - leveraging the device's built-in security features

## Benefits for Museum Visitors

Transitioning from QR code tickets to digital wallet tickets offers numerous advantages for museum-goers:

### Enhanced Convenience
- No need to search through emails or remember to download a specific app
- Tickets appear automatically on the lock screen upon arrival at the museum
- Multiple tickets for family or group visits can be managed in one place

### Improved Experience
- Push notifications for upcoming events or exhibitions
- Real-time updates to tickets if event details change
- Location-aware features that activate when approaching the museum

### Greater Security
