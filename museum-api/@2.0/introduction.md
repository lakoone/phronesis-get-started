# Introduction to Digital Wallet Ticketing

## What are Digital Wallet Tickets?

Digital wallet tickets are electronic passes that can be stored in mobile wallet applications like Apple Wallet and Google Pay. Unlike traditional paper tickets or QR code images, digital wallet tickets integrate directly with your smartphone's native applications, providing a more convenient and seamless experience.

## Benefits of Digital Wallet Ticketing
